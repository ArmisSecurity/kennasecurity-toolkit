1. Review output for expected data
1. Create Kenna Data Importer connector in Kenna (example name: MS Defender Atp KDI) 
1, Manually run the connector with the json from step 1 
1. Click on the name of the connector to get the connector id
1. Run the task with Microsoft Keys and Kenna Key/connector id
